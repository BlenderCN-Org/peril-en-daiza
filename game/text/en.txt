Once upon a time a panda tribe lived peacefully in the valley.
But one day, men choose to build a threatening factory there.
The tribe gathered around the Venerable panda who revealed the way to protect the valley.
They have to bring back the three blue bamboo sticks to summon the Great Panda'spirit.
"You boy, take my stick, its power will help you in your quest."
"Go, quick, hurry! Because without you, the valley is doomed."
