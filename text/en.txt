Since a long time ago, the panda tribe lived (peacefully) in the valley.
But one day, (the) men chose to build a horrible factory there.
Venerable/Wise panda then gathered the village and revealed them how to keep their valley (safe).
They had to bring back the three blue bamboo sticks that would let them summon the spirit of the Great Panda.
There boy/kid/buddy, take my stick, its power will help you in your quest.
Go, quick, hurry! Because without you/your help, the valley is lost/doomed...
